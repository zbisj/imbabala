## About

Imbabala is South African (Xhosa, Zulu, Hlubi) word meaning a bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) is a common and a widespread species of antelope in Sub-Saharan Africa. Bushbuck are found in a wide range of habitats, such as rain forests, montane forests, forest-savanna mosaic, savanna, bushveld and woodland.[3] Bushbuck stand about 90 centimetres (35 in) at the shoulder and weigh from 45 to 80 kilograms (99 to 176 lb). They are generally solitary, territorial browsers.

I named this library Imbabala becuase it my family's (Dlomo) totem and it is a beautiful animal with subtle features and its is independent, fast and agile.
